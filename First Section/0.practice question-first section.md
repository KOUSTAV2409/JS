### **Practice Questions**

#### **1. Basic Random Number Generation**
- **Q1.1:** Write a function that generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
- **Q1.2:** Modify the function from Q1.1 to generate a random integer between 1 and 10 (both inclusive).

#### **2. Random Number Generation with Custom Ranges**
- **Q2.1:** Create a function that generates a random integer between 5 and 15 (both inclusive).
- **Q2.2:** Write a function that generates a random floating-point number between -10.5 and 20.3.
- **Q2.3:** Modify the function in Q2.2 to round the generated number to two decimal places.

#### **3. String Indexing and Random Character Selection**
- **Q3.1:** Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a random character from the string.
- **Q3.2:** Modify the function from Q3.1 to ensure the last character in the string is always considered for selection.
- **Q3.3:** Write a function that generates a random string of 8 characters by randomly selecting characters from the string `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"`.

#### **4. Combination of Random Number Generation and String Manipulation**
- **Q4.1:** Create a function that generates a random password of a specified length. The password should include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (`!@#$%^&*()`).
- **Q4.2:** Write a function that shuffles a given string by randomly rearranging its characters.

#### **5. Advanced Challenges**
- **Q5.1:** Write a function that generates a random hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#3E2F1B`).
- **Q5.2:** Create a function that randomly selects and returns a quote from an array of quotes. Ensure that each quote has an equal chance of being selected.
- **Q5.3:** Write a function that simulates rolling two six-sided dice and returns their sum. Modify the function to simulate the rolling of three dice and returning the product of their values.

### **Bonus Questions for Deep Understanding**
- **Q6.1:** Explain why `Math.random()` is often multiplied by `(max - min)` in custom range generation.
- **Q6.2:** Describe how string indexing works in JavaScript and why indices start from 0.
