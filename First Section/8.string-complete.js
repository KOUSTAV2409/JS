// Here we will study about string in detail.

"user strict";

let string1="koustav "

let string2="ganguly"

// now we will merge two string with the use of string concatination:

console.log(string1+ string2);

// but this method of merging string has been outdated and we will not follow this practice

// we will use the concept of string interpolation:
// example:

console.log(`Hello my firstName is ${string1} and lastName is ${string2}`);

//  We can assign string inside a variable in mainly two ways:
// 1.
let myName="koustav"
console.log(myName);

// 2.
let lastName= new String ("ganguly")
console.log(lastName);



// See more usecase of different types of string operations in the exercise-day1.js
