// Here we will learn more about object and deep dive more into data types:-
// We can declare an object in two ways :-
// a) literal b) constructive

// Here we will learn more about literal way rather than constructive. Only thing i have to remember that there is a concept called "singleton". When we use constructive way to declare an object then "singleton" is created but in lieteral way "singleton" is not created.
// object.create() ==> this is constructive way of creating object
